  <h3>Types of Music</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Carnatic</em>
      <p> Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala
        and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka. It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Sanatana dharma sciences and traditions, particularly the Samaveda. The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged
        as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">Carnatic music</a> is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and
        even when played on instruments, they are meant to be
        performed in gāyaki (singing) style.</p>
    </li>

    <li><em>Western</em>
      <p> Western music is a form of country music composed by and about the people who settled and worked throughout the Western United States and Western Canada. <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_music_(North_America)#:~:text=Western%20music%20is%20a%20form,prairies%20of%20Western%20North%20America">Western music</a> celebrates the lifestyle of the cowboy on the open ranges, Rocky
        Mountains, and prairies of Western North America. Directly related musically to old English, Irish, Scottish, and folk ballads, also the Mexican folk music of Northern Mexico and Southwestern United States influenced the development of this
        genre, particularly corrido, ranchera, New Mexico and Tejano. Western music shares similar roots with Appalachian music (also called country or hillbilly music), which developed around the same time throughout Appalachia and the Appalachian
        Mountains. The music industry of the mid-20th century grouped the two genres together under the banner of country and western music, later amalgamated into the modern name, country music.</p>
